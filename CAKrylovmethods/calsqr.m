% Run the s-step CALSQR method to solve min||Ax=b|| 

%Input:
%A: mxn sparse matrix 
%b: right hand side of least squares system to solve, Ax=b; vector of dimension n
%s: number of inner-loop iterations per outer loop; the "s" in "s-step
%methods"
%maxits: maximum number of iterations to complete before returning
%tol: convergence criteria for computed residual 2-norm
%basis_type: string denoting which basis to use. Acceptable values are
% 'monomial', 'newton', or 'chebyshev'. If something besides these strings
% entered, will default to using monomial basis. 

%Output:
%results struct stores:
%r_exact_norm: 2-norm of true residual computed in each iteration
%(results.r_exact_norm)
%r_comp_norm: 2-norm of computed residual computed in each iteration
%(results.r_comp_norm)
%x: approximate solution computed in each iteration
%(results.x)
